# api-router Smart Contract

A [smart contract] written in [AssemblyScript] for an app initialized with [create-near-app], however modified so that:

- Only assembly directory remains (as no web front-end)

# Quick Start

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn build`
3. `yarn test`

# Exploring The Code

1. The main smart contract code lives in `index.ts`. You can compile
   it with the `./compile` script or `yard build`.
