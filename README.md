# API Router

This is a repository for the API Router project for the NEAR Certified Developer Program.

The idea is to create a router for API call requests to, as a first step, organize the requests until they reach a critial mass. This first step involves the following steps:

# Features to Implement

1. [x] Create stub contract (could be email, text, ML tasks, etc.)
   1. SMS (sms.apirouter.wombat.testnet)
   2. Email (email.apirouter.wombat.testnet)
   3. Phone (phone.apirouter.wombat.testnet)
2. [x] Create apiouter contract, with input as stub contract type, number of units.
   1. If Router has enough contracts, will execute matching stub contract type. Return value of contract type.
   2. Otherwise, will increment contract count of that type. Return nothing.
3. [ ] Translate above architecture from count-based to token based.
   1. Create a mechanism that's equivalent of pre-authorization/hold on near account calling the routerapi (escrow? lockup?)
   2. Change apirouter to accept three arguments - $total near token willing to be spent, $amount per stub execution allowed, time allowed for task
   3. Change stubs to include stub current cost/execution.
   4. Change apirouter to schedule stubs to be executed if $stub currentcost/execution is less than/equal to $total near token willing to be spent.

This takes advantage of the tiering model for example, of APIs such as Google Maps or Twilio. There seems to be some work done on
APIs being natively available on the blockchain (e.g. [Airnode](https://medium.com/api3/airnode-the-api-gateway-for-blockchains-8b07ff136840)),
but not much on API gateways or routers.

# Motivation

The current ways to batch calls, etc. involve creating your own gateway aggregation pattern, or own lambda calls. Other than scheduling, there's
no way to value API calls by time, volume, $, etc. Introducing NEAR adds an economic component to the API call so we can sanely bundle calls.

# api-router Smart Contract

A [smart contract] written in [AssemblyScript] for an app initialized with [create-near-app], however modified so that:

- Only assembly directory remains (as no web front-end)

# Quick Start

Before you compile this code, you will need to install [Node.js] â‰¥ 12, then:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn build`
3. `yarn test`

# Exploring The Code

1. The main smart contract code lives in `index.ts`. You can compile
   it with the `./compile` script or `yard build`.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script or `yarn test`. This runs
   standard AssemblyScript tests using [as-pect].

# Questions

1. In terms of creating sub-accounts, why can't wombat.testnet create domains 1 level remoted to it? For example, wombat.testnet can't create email.apirouter.wombat.testnet? Does it cost
2. Why am i returning Void for the promise?
3.
